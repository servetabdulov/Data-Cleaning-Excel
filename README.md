- `after_cleaning.xlsx`: The corrected dataset obtained after the cleaning process.

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: The raw dataset is examined, and areas requiring cleaning are identified.
2. **Cleaning Process**: Missing or erroneous data is corrected, unnecessary columns are removed, and data formats are fixed.
3. **Validation**: The cleaned dataset is re-examined and validated.
4. **Saving**: The cleaned dataset is stored in a new file.
